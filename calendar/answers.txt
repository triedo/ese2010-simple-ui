1. Explain how a typical HTTP request is processed with the framework (the request lifecycle)

A Play project is split into 3 parts: the model, the view and the controller
Whenever the framework receive a request, the corresponding action method in the Controller will be invoked. This action method
reads/updates the model. With the render method (last line in the action method) the controller passes information to update the
view. After that a HTTP response (with informations about the new view) is send back. 
   

2. How could you test user interfaces with the testing facilities in play! framework?

With "Selenium" tests. They are written using HTML tables.


3.Why does my project not work and what I tried until now 

It seems that I failed to create some test objects and store them;
-first I tryed to do that like it's written in the exerscise, by a Bootstrap class. I created just one user and add him to 
the database [ albert = new User("albert123","abcd"); Database.addNewUser("alber123",albert); ]

- because I got NullPointerExeptions I also tried a setupDatabase() method in my Database class. Then I called this method 
everywhere I need sample data. Like you can see that also failed!
